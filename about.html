<h1> A Brief History of Minnesota </h1> 
<p> The territory of Minnesota was declared the 32nd state of the United States on May 11, 1858. 
The word Minnesota comes from two Sioux Native American words meaning &#39;Cloudy Water&#39; and the prefix &#39;
Minne&#39; is incorporated in many cities, lakes, rivers and other natural land masses throughout the state due 
to it&#39;s meaning of &#39;water&#39;. Minnesota&#39;s nicknames are &#39;The North Star State&#39;, &#39;The Gopher State&#39;, &#39;The Agate State&#39;, 
&#39;The State of Hockey&#39;, and most commonly &#39;Land of 10,000 Lakes&#39; due to the fact that it contains the most amount of lakes 
of any state in the United States (do not let anyone from Michigan or Wisconsin tell you otherwise, because they are lying). 
The phrase &#39;Land of 10,000 Lakes&#39; however is actually misleading, because there are actually 11,842 lakes of 10 acres or 
more, and if all water basins over 2.5 acres were counted, Minnesota would actually have 21,871 lakes. </p> 

<p> Minnesota is the 12th largest state by area and the 22nd largest state by population. 
Approximately 60% of the population lives within the Minneapolis/St. Paul, better known as the Twin Cities, 
metro area, which is located in the South-western part of the state. The other well known city in Minnesota, 
Duluth, is located on the North Shore along Lake Superior, however is significantly smaller in size to the Twin 
Cities. Minnesota has historically become known for having an extremely progressive political orientation with a 
very informed and civically active populous. </p> 

<p> Prior to colonization, the area of Minnesota was inhabited by the primarily the Native American tribes the Ojibwe, 
Dakota and the Sioux. During the 19th century, a flood of the European immigration, primarily from Scandinavian 
countries and Germany came into Minnesota, leading to what is still today a very rich Scandinavian and German culture and 
history that has flourished within the state. In more recent decades, there has been a large increase in immigration to 
Minnesota from many parts of Asia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America which has significantly increased 
the diversity and culture of Minneapolis and the state as a whole. </p>
